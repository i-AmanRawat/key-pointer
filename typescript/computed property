The two examples you provided differ in how they define object keys. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **1. First Example**
```typescript
const colorStatus: Record<TaskStatus, string> = {
  [TaskStatus.BACKLOG]: "border-l-pink-500",
  [TaskStatus.DONE]: "border-l-red-500",
  [TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS]: "border-l-yellow-500",
  [TaskStatus.IN_REVIEW]: "border-l-blue-500",
  [TaskStatus.TODO]: "border-l-emerald-500",
};
```

#### **Key Features:**
- **Computed property syntax:** The keys are wrapped in square brackets (`[ ]`).
- **Resulting keys:** The actual string values of the `TaskStatus` enum (e.g., `"BACKLOG"`, `"DONE"`, etc.) are used as keys in the resulting object.

#### **Why use computed properties?**
- **Dynamic keys:** You can dynamically evaluate expressions for keys.
- It is required when using enums or other expressions as object keys to properly resolve the value.

---

### **2. Second Example**
```typescript
const colorStatus: Record<TaskStatus, string> = {
  TaskStatus.BACKLOG: "border-l-pink-500",
  TaskStatus.DONE: "border-l-red-500",
  TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS: "border-l-yellow-500",
  TaskStatus.IN_REVIEW: "border-l-blue-500",
  TaskStatus.TODO: "border-l-emerald-500",
};
```

#### **Key Features:**
- **No computed properties:** The keys are written directly as `TaskStatus.BACKLOG`, `TaskStatus.DONE`, etc.
- **Resulting keys:** Here, `TaskStatus.BACKLOG`, `TaskStatus.DONE`, etc., are treated as **literals**, not resolved to their actual values.

#### **Why doesn't this work?**
- JavaScript interprets `TaskStatus.BACKLOG` as a literal key, not the enum's value. Without square brackets, it assumes you're using a static property name rather than evaluating the enum's value.

---

### **3. Why Use Square Brackets?**
Enums in TypeScript are resolved to their values during runtime. When using an enum value as an object key, you must **compute it dynamically** using square brackets to avoid TypeScript assuming a literal string like `"TaskStatus.BACKLOG"`.

---

### **4. How the Object Actually Looks After Compilation**
#### Using Computed Properties:
```typescript
{
  BACKLOG: "border-l-pink-500",
  DONE: "border-l-red-500",
  IN_PROGRESS: "border-l-yellow-500",
  IN_REVIEW: "border-l-blue-500",
  TODO: "border-l-emerald-500",
}
```

#### Without Computed Properties (Second Example):
```typescript
{
  "TaskStatus.BACKLOG": "border-l-pink-500",
  "TaskStatus.DONE": "border-l-red-500",
  "TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS": "border-l-yellow-500",
  "TaskStatus.IN_REVIEW": "border-l-blue-500",
  "TaskStatus.TODO": "border-l-emerald-500",
}
```

---

### **5. Which One Should You Use?**
**Use the computed property syntax (`[TaskStatus.BACKLOG]`)**, as it properly resolves the enum values. The second approach is incorrect for this scenario because it does not evaluate the enum values, leading to an unexpected object structure.
